This task requires us to write a small program that can be given away to be used to manage everyday school days. I am to create a program that will help cafe managers
to track students orders. I will be one of many computing students who will be creating a program, so they requested that I come up with my own design without being
too limited by design constraints. I am therefore to design my own program.
